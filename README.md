# Todo Application

Â© 2017 Dominic V. Lacroix

This project is an example of a simple full-stack MERN application.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). It uses simple React components, state management, and an Express server to interact with a MongoDB database to provide CRUD operations.
